# Takehome Assignment

This is a Rust writeup of a certain takehome assignment to produce a simplified version of a 
profile and product registration

## To build

The code is written in Rust and the service can be started in debug mode via

```bash
cargo run
```

Alternatively, a dockerfile is provided for both building the service and running the service in the docker container
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t profile_backend .
# Run Docker image
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 profile_backend
```
